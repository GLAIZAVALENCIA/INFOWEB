          <h3>Skills in Programming</h3>
          <li>As a CS student, I have to developed a diverse set of skills that allow me to solve complex 
            problems efficiently. I am proficient in multiple programming languages such as Java,
             C language,C++ and C# which enable me to adapt to different project requirements.
              My ability to write clean and maintainable code ensures that my programs are not only
               functional but also easy to understand for future developers. I take pride in my
                problem-solving skills, breaking down complicated tasks into manageable steps. 
                Debugging is one of my strengths, and I can quickly identify issues and fix them. 
                 Collaboration is key in programming, and I enjoy working in teams where I can learn from
                  others while sharing my own knowledge. I also value continuous learning, regularly keeping
                   up with the latest technologies and programming trends. Time management is crucial in
                    programming, and I ensure that I meet deadlines without compromising on the quality of my
                     work. Overall, my skills in programming help me tackle challenges and create efficient, 
                     user-friendly software solutions.</li>
          
          <h3>Public Speaking</h3>
          <li>Public speaking has always been a challenge for me, but I’ve come to realize its importance in 
            both personal and professional life. When I stand in front of an audience, I feel a mix of 
            excitement and nervousness. I focus on organizing my thoughts clearly, making sure my message 
            is concise and engaging. Eye contact helps me connect with the audience, and it makes me feel more 
            confident as I see their reactions. I’ve learned that preparation is key, so I always rehearse my
             speech multiple times. However, I also leave room for spontaneity to keep it authentic.
              My voice, tone, and body language are just as important as my words, and I strive to keep them 
              aligned with my message. Over time, I’ve improved my public speaking skills by seeking feedback
               and learning from my mistakes. Despite the nerves, I now enjoy the opportunity to share my
                ideas and inspire others. Each time I speak, it feels like a small step toward becoming a 
                better communicator.

          <h3>Time Management </h3>
          <li>Time management is something I constantly strive to improve in my daily life. 
            I find that when I plan my day ahead, I’m more productive and less stressed. 
            I start by prioritizing tasks that are most important or have strict deadlines. 
            I try to break down larger projects into smaller, manageable steps, which helps me stay
             focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed. Occasionally, distractions can throw me off track, 
             but I’m learning to set boundaries, such as limiting social media during work hours.
              I also allocate time for short breaks to recharge, which helps me stay fresh throughout the day.
               Sometimes, things don’t go as planned, and I remind myself to be flexible and adapt.
                Balancing work, study, and personal time can be tricky, but I believe consistency is key. 
                I try to reflect at the end of the day to see what worked well and what I can improve. 
                By managing my time better, I feel more in control of my schedule and my goals. </li>
